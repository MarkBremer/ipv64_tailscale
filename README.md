# ipv64_tailscale
Create, delete, and update subdomain records on ipv64.net for all connected Tailscale devices. Useful for dynamically managing DNS entries in a Tailscale-powered network.

Unfortunately, Tailescale's MagicDNS feature doesn't work reliaby in my setup - some of my devices lose internet connectivity when it's enabled :(
This tool provides a workaround by registering DNS records via ipv64.net
